# bust

bust is a Work-In-Progress bus timetable and public transit data in your terminal, written in Rust.

# Description

A [computer club](https://cyberia.club) I am part of has a [physical space](https://layerze.ro) that I would like to get to by bus. I figured it would be really cool to have a computer terminal at the space with a fully functional bus timetable on display. Since this doesn't exist yet, I am making it!

Currently using this project to build my Rust muscles.

# Installation

Currently, this code is unpublished beyond this git repo, and I have not bothered to create any binary releases, you will need to install from source.

To do this you need to have Rust installed on your system:
1. Follow the relevant guide to install rust for your system here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. clone this github repo into a local directory ```git clone https://github.com/facklambda/bust.git```
3. run ```cargo build bust``` within the newly cloned local repo

NOT YET compatible with the following public transit providers:
