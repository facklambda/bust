# bust

bust is a Work-In-Progress Bus timetable and public transit data in your terminal, written in rust.

# Description

A [computer club](https://cyberia.club) I am part of has a [physical space](https://layerze.ro) that I would like to get to by bus, as there is a bus stop right outside. I figured it would be really cool to have a computer terminal at the space with a fully functional bus timetable installed. Since this doesn't exist yet I am making it!

Currently using this project to build my Rust muscles.

NOT YET compatible with the following public transit providers:
* Metro Transit
